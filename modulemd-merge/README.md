# modulemd-merge

### merge several modules.yaml files into one

This is useful for example if you have several yum repositories and want
to merge them into one. If they are module-enabled, you also have to merge
their modules.yaml files (linked in the repomd.xml). Otherwise the modularity
system will break for them, as the moduled rpms won't be filtered properly
anymore.

Another usecase is if you want to mirror a yum repository and the source
expires older files, but you want to keep these expired files locally, for
example to allow downgrades. modulemd-merge can then be used to merge the
previous modules.yaml file with the new one after each mirror update.
This way the module information for the expired rpms is preserved.
